# List and Tuples

# list - ordered collection. Order matters. [ bracked make it a list]


# x = [4, True, 'hi']
# # index 0,1,2,3
# x[0] = "change"
# print(x)


# x.append('hello')
# x.extend([5,7,6,5,4])

# print(x.pop())
# print(x.pop())
# print(x)

# y = ['hi',4,5.6,"hello"]

# print(len(y))


# tuple is an immutable list, that uses ()

# x = (5,5,4,3)

# can't append, extend, change elements within a tuple
